## 0.6.5 (June 3, 2022)

### Dependency Upgrade

### Dependency Upgrades

- `twilio-video` has been upgraded from 2.18.2 to to 2.19.0. This new version introduces a new feature called Adaptive Simulcast. When this feature is enabled (by setting `preferredVideoCodecs: "auto"` in the [ConnectOptions](https://sdk.twilio.com/js/video/releases/2.19.0/docs/global.html#ConnectOptions)), the SDK will use VP8 simulcast, and will enable/disable simulcast layers dynamically, thus improving bandwidth and CPU usage for the publishing client. For more information, please see [this changelog entry](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2190-january-31-2022) for the [Twilio Video JS SDK](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js).

## 0.6.1 (December 17, 2021)

### Dependency Upgrades

- `twilio-video` has been upgraded from 2.17.1 to 2.18.2.
- `@twilio/video-room-monitor` has been updated from version `1.0.0-beta.1` to `1.0.0`. The [Twilio Video Room Monitor](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-room-monitor.js) is out of beta and is now Generally Available.

### Enhancements

- The Twilio Video Room Monitor can now be used on mobile devices.

## 0.6.0 (September 24, 2021)

### New Feature

- This release adds the [Twilio Video Room Monitor](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-room-monitor.js) to the app. The Room Monitor is a browser-based tool that displays real-time information and metrics from the Video SDK's [Room object](https://media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/js/video/releases/2.17.0/docs/Room.html) and relevant browser APIs. The Room Monitor can be activated by clicking on the "Room Monitor" button in the menu while in a room. [#594](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/594)

### Dependency Upgrades

- `twilio-video` has been upgraded from 2.17.0 to 2.17.1. This fixes a regression in 2.17.0 which caused Chrome screen share tracks to be encoded at lower dimensions. [#593](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/593)

## 0.5.1 (September 17, 2021)

### Dependency Upgrades

- `twilio-video` has been upgraded from 2.15.3 to 2.17.0. Twilio-video.js now supports Chrome on iOS versions 14.3 and above. With this upgrade, the `isSupported` boolean will be `true` in iOS Chrome, and users will be able to use the video app instead of seeing the `<UnsupportedBrowserWarning />` component. [#590](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/590)

### Bugfixes

- Fixes issue with the MainParticipant erroneously displaying the network quality for the LocalParticipant. [#585](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/585)
- Improves interoperability with Twilio's iOS and Android quickstart apps. This app now will display any video track as the participant's main video, unless the video track has the name `screen` (to indicate a screenshare track). Previously, this app would only display video tracks with the name `camera`, which meant that participants that used Twilio's iOS and Android quickstart apps could not be seen by users of this video app. [#585](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/585)

## 0.5.0 (August 9, 2021)

### New Feature

- This release adds a virtual background feature. This feature allows users to blur their background or apply a background image from the background selection window. The virtual backgrounds are applied to the video tracks using the [Twilio Video Processors SDK](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/video-processors). For more information, please view this [blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/introducing-virtual-backgrounds-browser-based-video-applications).

### Dependency Upgrades

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js/issues/1528) for more information. [#562](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/562)

### Bugfixes

- Audio and Video track components now set their `<audio>` or `<video>` element's `srcObject` to `null` after the tracks are unmounted. This helps to fix the above mentioned issue introduced in Chrome 92. [#562](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video-app-react/pull/562)

## 0.4.1 (June 10, 2021)

## 0.3.2 (May 11, 2021)

### New Feature

This release upgrades `twilio-video` to version 2.14.0 which contains a significant update to the Bandwidth Profile API. This new version deprecates the `maxTracks` and `renderDimensions` settings and introduces the `clientTrackSwitchOffControl` and `contentPreferencesMode` settings. The "Connection Settings" modal in this app has been updated to reflect these new options.

The `clientTrackSwitchOffControl` and `contentPreferencesMode` settings allow for more efficient use of bandwidth and CPU in multi-party applications.

## 0.2.0 (September 30, 2020)

This release contains support for the Programmable Video Go room type and an overhauled UI/UX experience.

### Go Room Type

The Go room type provides a similar peer-to-peer video app experience except for a smaller limit of two participants. If more than two participants join a room with this room type, then the video app will present an error. To learn more about Go, please visit the [Twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/announcing-twilio-video-webrtc-go).

### Design Refresh

The user journey was redesigned from the ground up. Users are now presented with an updated “lobby” experience prior to joining the room. Users can select their audio and video devices, configure their connection settings, and leverage a new beta [Video JS SDK Preflight API](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-video.js/blob/preflight_api/CHANGELOG.md#280-beta1-september-28-2020) to determine if their network connection is suitable to provide an optimal video app experience.

Users are then presented with an updated “in room” experience. All of the media and room controls have been moved to a dedicated toolbar at the bottom of the page and the primary view remains the dominant speaker or the participant sharing their screen. In general the experience feels similar to before with just much more polish!

Additionally, all the UI/UX improvements have been implemented on mobile web browsers as well.

## 0.1.0 (March 6, 2020)

This release marks the first iteration of the Twilio Video Collaboration App: a canonical multi-party collaboration video application built with Programmable Video. This application demonstrates the capabilities of Programmable Video and serves as a reference to developers building video apps.

This initial release comes with the following features:

- Join rooms with up to 50 participants
- Toggle local media: camera, audio, and screen.
- Show a Room’s dominant speaker in the primary video view
- Show a participant’s network quality

We intend to iterate on this initial set of features and we look forward to collaborating with the community.
