## 0.1.0

This release marks the first iteration of the Twilio Video Collaboration App: a canonical multi-party collaboration video application built with Programmable Video. This application demonstrates the capabilities of Programmable Video and serves as a reference to developers building video apps.

This initial release comes with the following features:

- Join rooms with up to 50 participants
- Toggle local media: camera, audio, and screen.
- Show a Room’s dominant speaker in the primary video view
- Show a participant’s network quality

We intend to iterate on this initial set of features and we look forward to collaborating with the community.
